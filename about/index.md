**Hey there!**

I'm Aniruddha Mysore, a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India. I love `Technology`, `Science`, `Programming`, `Science Fiction and Fantasy`, `Linkin Park`, and `Making`. This blog is mostly technical, barring a few of my philosophical rants on life. 

If you have an ideas you wish to share with me about this blog, or anything under the sun, please drop me a line.
